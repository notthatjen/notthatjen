ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m **Jen Villaganas**, a **Senior Software Engineer** at [Tonic Labs](https://toniclabs.ltd) My role is quite dynamicâ€”my managers trust me to tackle a wide range of challenges, from web development in Rails and NextJs to building 3D scanning applications with SwiftUI and photogrammetry. I also work on Solana web3 projects, create npm packages, Ruby gems, and conduct data analytics to help clients understand data changes.
