<h1 align="center">Yo ðŸ‘‹, I'm Jen</h1>

Iâ€™m currently living in DasmariÃ±as city of Cavite, Philippines. I work in Software in different roles â€” Iâ€™ve been a Chatbot Developer, Software Engineer, and have also worked with Crypto Projects and Web Based Game Developments.

I guess whatâ€™s special about me isnâ€™t really with my expertise on different technologies, but how I can solve different kinds of challenging problems. I always try to find a way to solve things in an efficient way without compromising user experience.
