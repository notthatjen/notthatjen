<h1 align="center">Yo 👋, I'm Jen</h1>

I’m currently living in Dasmariñas city of Cavite, Philippines. I work in Software in different roles — I’ve been a Chatbot Developer, Software Engineer, and have also worked with Crypto Projects and Web Based Game Developments.

I guess what’s special about me isn’t really with my expertise on different technologies, but how I can solve different kinds of challenging problems. I always try to find a way to solve things in an efficient way without compromising user experience.
